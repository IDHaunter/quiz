# quiz
This project helped me learn Flutter and Dart.
Thanks CodeAndArt youtube channel, my deepest respects to the author!
You can create your own quiz just changing model in question.dart

## A few standard resources to get started:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
